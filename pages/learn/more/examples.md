# Examples

### Seed projects

A list of [seed projects](seed-projects/), "hello world" applications written in different languages, which are designed to form the basis of your own projects written in each language.

### Snippets

[Snippets](snippets/) are a collection of base projects, that focus on specific functionality, and are a nice base to start a project from.

### Projects

Some awesome [projects](projects/) built using {{ $names.company.lower }} and are a lot more fully featured and complete than the code snippets.
