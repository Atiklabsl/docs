#### Setting up {{ $language.name }} cross-compilation

Cross-compilation is not needed when using `{{ $names.company.short }} sync` and {{ $language.name }} as it is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages are programming languages in which programs may be run from source code form, they do not need to be compiled.
